      <td>  The marketplace gives players the opportunity to offer tasks that have to be completed by their colleagues
so that they are able to fulfil those tasks and obtain the respective reward. Upon creation of a task, an
initial bid in terms of coins is set, which will be obtained as additional reward. Via Bids this initial bid
can be raised. To be able to create offers, a marketplace for the organisation is needed. If none exists yet,
it first has to be created.

If an offer is created an initial bid in terms of coins is set which is obtained by the person who completes
it. The initial bid can be raised by other colleagues in order to increase the incentive of fulfilling the
task. When a player has completed a Task that belongs to an offer, she/he will obtain all bids as a reward.
The particular task is then also added to the playerâ€™s list of the finished tasks. All offers a player has
put on the marketplace can be requested. The name of an offer can be changed at a later point of time as
well as the optional date when an offer ends or the deadline when the associated task of an offer should be
done at the latest.

At the marketplace not all offers may are visible for each player because the offers can be filtered by the
roles a player has. It can also additionally filtered by the date an offer was created or the prize which
can be earned. By making a bid, the reward of coins for completing a task is raised. The bidden amount of
coins will be subtracted from the bidderâ€™s current account and will be added to the offerâ€™s current prize.
Each player can make several bids on condition that her/his coins are enough otherwise the bid cannot be
made. It is also possible to get all bids that was made for an offer.

organisation. The API key is uniquely in the whole application. It

a level is set to "0". These can be raised by fulfilling tasks in the gamification application. Furthermore
a player can have an avatar, by specifying the path of an image previously uploaded to a server.
A player can be set active or can be deactivated so that she/he cannot complete tasks. In addition to create

associated id or all players of the organisation. The avatar of one player can also be requested. To display
the status of a player ancillary the already finished goals and finished tasks it can be requested all earned
permanent rewards. If only one status element is needed, the current points, coins, badges or achievements
can be gotten instead.
Each player can also have a list of contacts which represent other players in the same organisation, so players
can send them little presents.
At a later point of time it is possible to change the password, nickname, avatar and the roles or contacts a
player has.
In the responses the player's password and avatar isn't returned because of security reasons respectively overload.
To get the avatar of a player a specific get request can be sent ("/player/{id}/avatar").

When a member of a group completed such a task the group obtains its rewards.

Like a player, a group can be assigned an image as a logo. This can either be
done when creating the group or later through a PUT query. Later players can
also be added to a group or the groupâ€™s name can be changed.

      <td>  A role describes which members of an organisation is allowed to do or see
particular elements of the engine such as to fulfil a particular task and get
its rewards. Each Player can have many different roles such as one for his
occupation or the department in which she/he works. But the roles can also be a
part of an invented role system that isnâ€™t oriented towards the work context. All
roles are specific to the respective created organisation.
Ancillary creating and deleting, either all roles of a specific organisation or with
a given id the associated role can be gotten.
The name of one role can also be changed at a later point of time.

      <td>  With a Goalrule can be defined which tasks and if all or only one task have to be fulfilled to reach a goal.
When a goal rule is fulfilled the goal is added to the playerâ€™s list of finished goals. If the goal can also
be done by a group it is also added to its list of finished goals. There are two types of rules that can be
defined: a TaskRule or a PointsRule.
All created rules which are created in the context of one specific organisation can be requested with the
appendant API key. With the given id also a particular rule can be requested, also for example to change some
attributes like the name, the description or, if it is a PointsRule, the amount of points which has to be
reached.

      <td>  A Task is the basic module and represents for example a specific activity. For a creation
of a task, the roles are needed which indicate who is allowed to fulfil this task. To
complete the task only one of these roles is needed. One or more tasks can be assigned to
a goal, so depending on the rule of the goal some additional tasks may also have to be
completed to fulfill the goal so the player can earn the associated rewards. If the task
is tradeable it can be offered in the marketplace, so that another player can do it and
gets the reward of it.

When a player has completed a task, it will be added to the playerâ€™s list of finished
tasks. At the same time the date and time is also stored when this request was sent and the
task was officially be done. If the task is the last one to fulfill a goal, the goal is also
added to the playerâ€™s list of finished goals and the player will obtain all its associated
rewards.
It is possible to query all tasks which are associated with a particular organisation or with
the help of the associated id one specific task. When a task was created it is possible to
change the taskâ€™s name, description and roles of players who are allowed to fulfil this task.
Furthermore a task can be set tradeable or not at a later point of time.
