      <td>  The marketplace gives players the opportunity to offer tasks that have to be completed by their colleagues
so that they are able to fulfil those tasks and obtain the respective reward. Upon creation of a task, an
initial bid in terms of coins is set, which will be obtained as additional reward. Via Bids this initial bid
can be raised. To be able to create offers, a marketplace for the organisation is needed. If none exists yet,
it first has to be created.

If an offer is created an initial bid in terms of coins is set which is obtained by the person who completes
it. The initial bid can be raised by other colleagues in order to increase the incentive of fulfilling the
task. When a player has completed a Task that belongs to an offer, she/he will obtain all bids as a reward.
The particular task is then also added to the playerâ€™s list of the finished tasks. All offers a player has
put on the marketplace can be requested. The name of an offer can be changed at a later point of time as
well as the optional date when an offer ends or the deadline when the associated task of an offer should be
done at the latest.

At the marketplace not all offers may are visible for each player because the offers can be filtered by the
roles a player has. It can also additionally filtered by the date an offer was created or the prize which
can be earned. By making a bid, the reward of coins for completing a task is raised. The bidden amount of
coins will be subtracted from the bidderâ€™s current account and will be added to the offerâ€™s current prize.
Each player can make several bids on condition that her/his coins are enough otherwise the bid cannot be
made. It is also possible to get all bids that was made for an offer.

because all database entries are associated with this unique key and so with the respective
organisation. The API key is uniquely in the whole application. It
may be changed, for this reason it has no primary key.
When an Organisation is created it has to be connected with an account. Each organisation
may be managed by many people, but at least by one who is added to the list of the manager
of the respective organisation and so also the Account.
In the response of all requests the account's password isn't returned because of security

rewards, already finished Goals and finished Tasks. The initial value of possible points, coins and index of
a level is set to "0". These can be raised by fulfilling tasks in the gamification application. Furthermore
a player can have an avatar, by specifying the path of an image previously uploaded to a server.
A player can be set active or can be deactivated so that she/he cannot complete tasks. In addition to create
and to delete a player it is possible to get one particular player of one specific organisation by her/his
associated id or all players of the organisation. The avatar of one player can also be requested. To display
the status of a player ancillary the already finished goals and finished tasks it can be requested all earned
permanent rewards. If only one status element is needed, the current points, coins, badges or achievements
can be gotten instead.
Each player can also have a list of contacts which represent other players in the same organisation, so players
can send them little presents.
At a later point of time it is possible to change the password, nickname, avatar and the roles or contacts a
player has.
In the responses the player's password and avatar isn't returned because of security reasons respectively overload.
To get the avatar of a player a specific get request can be sent ("/player/{id}/avatar").
